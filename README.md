# Skateshop Android Application ðŸ›¹

This is my first android app! I made this in submission to the ["Creating Android Apps for Beginners"](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/51) course in Dicoding Indonesia. This app implements some very basic android application components such as:

1. Activity
2. Intents
3. Recycler View

This app features a catalogue of 10 skateboard decks with different brands from SKATEDELUXE, GX1000, Passport, and Palace Skateboards. For each of the item in the catalogue, you can look at the details on the brand by clicking at the detail button. You can also click at the about to see the seller information.
